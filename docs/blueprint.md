## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark charcoal gray (#333333) for a modern, comfortable dark theme. It's a sophisticated color, leaning toward the professional but appropriate for an e-commerce store.
- Primary color: Vivid purple (#A020F0) for a strong, eye-catching and modern feel. Purple is unconventional but can work well with tech and style forward e-commerce offerings.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) to highlight key CTAs and interactive elements, contrasting against the purple. Being an analogous color, blue has the modern technology look and feel appropriate for this type of application.
- Body and headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a clean, geometric, modern feel, as requested by the user.
- Use filled icons with a consistent style, such as those from the Material Design library.
- Modern, responsive layout with rounded corners and a clear visual hierarchy, optimized for performance and SEO. Each client's payment history should be expandable from a single line to reveal full details, which contributes to a clean interface.
- Implement subtle animations like a moving magnifying glass (search icon) to enhance user experience without being distracting.
